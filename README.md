# Assessing Post-Graduation Perceptions: A Multilingual Psychometric Evaluation of Students' Life Readiness

## Introduction and Aims 
The purpose of this survey is to explore students' perceptions and experiences of life after graduation, focusing on  professional aspirations, financial stability, personal growth, social life, and overall well-being. Administered in English, Hindi, and Mandarin the survey ensures inclusivity and captures the cultural nuances of this transition. By analyzing data across linguistic and cultural contexts, the study examines how education shapes readiness for post-graduation challenges and opportunities.
Through psychometric analysis, we seek to validate this instrument and assess its ability to capture the diverse perspectives and experiences of students. Ultimately, this work addresses a research gap by providing a reliable tool to evaluate the multifaceted aspects of students' transitions from academia to broader life stages across varied cultural settings.

## Research Gap
Despite extensive research on student life, significant gaps remain in understanding life transitions post-education across stages such as undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate. Existing psychometric tools often focus on narrow constructs, like career decision-making self-efficacy or academic satisfaction, without addressing the multifaceted challenges and expectations of broader life transitions.1 While career-related self-efficacy tools primarily target decision-making, they neglect other dimensions of life beyond academia. 2
Research on burnout and engagement highlights the interplay of personal and professional development, yet the transition from education to career is underexplored.³ Furthermore, motivational theories such as self-determination theory emphasize intrinsic motivation and goal pursuit but lack specific application to students’ societal roles post-education.⁴ Finally, while the process of psychometric scale development is well-documented,⁵ there is a pressing need for tools that holistically evaluate students’ perceptions and experiences during these critical transitions. Addressing these gaps could provide insights into how students navigate life beyond formal education, enabling tailored interventions and support systems.

## Construct and Item Development :
The construct of interest for this study is students’ perceptions of life after graduation, focusing on their expectations, preparedness, and confidence in navigating post-education transitions. The construct is multidimensional, encompassing professional, financial, personal, social, and emotional aspects of life, as well as overall perceptions of well-being and societal contribution. Each dimension was carefully conceptualized to reflect key areas of concern and interest among graduating students.  
The item development process began with a comprehensive literature review on life transitions, career preparedness, and post-graduation challenges. Key themes identified included professional aspirations, financial independence, personal adaptability, social support systems, emotional resilience, and overall life satisfaction. Based on these themes, a pool of 20 initial survey items was generated, each crafted to be clear, concise, and relevant, utilizing a 7-point Likert scale to capture varying levels of agreement.  
To ensure cultural appropriateness and inclusivity, the survey underwent a forward-backward translation process into Hindi and Mandarin by bilingual experts, ensuring conceptual equivalence and minimizing linguistic biases. Pilot testing with a diverse sample of students provided feedback that informed revisions, enhancing item clarity and relevance. Items were further refined to ensure alignment with the construct’s theoretical framework, resulting in a final set of 14 items distributed across the identified dimensions.  
 This meticulous process ensures that the instrument is comprehensive, culturally sensitive, and psychometrically sound, facilitating accurate measurement of students’ perceptions and experiences during this pivotal life stage.
Psychometric analysis evaluated the survey’s reliability, validity, and overall performance. For reliability, Cronbach’s Alpha assessed internal consistency across three language groups. Item-total correlation (r.cor) evaluated how well individual items aligned with the construct of "life perception after graduation," while r.drop assessed survey reliability after item removal. Items with higher r.cor and r.drop values demonstrated stronger consistency with the overall scale. Analyzing these metrics separately for each language group highlighted how cultural and linguistic differences influenced item reliability and consistency.
Construct validity examined whether the survey accurately measured constructs like career opportunities, financial goals, and personal growth. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) identified latent factors and assessed how well items loaded onto them. Separate EFAs for each language group revealed variations in factor structure, providing insights into potential cultural or linguistic effects. Parallel analysis determined the optimal number of factors, representing dimensions such as professional life, financial stability, and emotional well-being. Then the results of exploratory factor analysis will indicate the magnitude of association between the latent factor and the items. For example, when two hypothesized factors were identified, the loadings of MR1 (first factor) and MR2 (second factor) were examined for each language version. Items with higher MR1 values align strongly with the first factor. Comparing factor loadings across language groups revealed how cultural and linguistic differences influence item alignment with hypothesized factor structures.
Criterion validity relied on correlation analysis to evaluate relationships among items, given the absence of external benchmarks. A correlation matrix captures the strength and direction of relationships within and across constructs. High correlations between related items, such as PL_1 and PL_2 ("Professional Life Development"), confirmed that these items effectively captured their intended dimensions. Conversely, low correlations indicated weaker alignment with the intended construct, suggesting a need for refinement. Unexpectedly high correlations between items from different constructs, such as OLP_1 ("Overall Life Perception") and PL_1, signaled potential construct overlap or insufficient independence. These findings emphasized the importance of refining item wording and structure to improve construct differentiation.
This analysis highlights the importance of assessing reliability, construct validity, and criterion validity across different language groups. Considering cultural and linguistic differences ensures that the survey captures the intended constructs accurately and provides meaningful, reliable data for psychometric evaluation.

## Results and Comparison to Existing Measures
The results of the psychometric analysis demonstrate that the survey instrument developed for assessing students’ perceptions of life after graduation is both reliable and valid. Referring to the Appendix Figures 2,4, and 6, Cronbach’s Alpha values for the English survey (0.70; standardized 0.75), Mandarin survey (0.91; standardized 0.92), and Hindi survey (0.96; standardized 0.96) indicate acceptable to excellent internal consistency across all three language groups. The item-total correlations (r.cor) and reliability-after-removal statistics (r.drop) further confirm that most items align well with the overarching construct, although some items, such as MEW_1 in the English survey, showed weaker alignment.
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) revealed variations in factor structures across language groups. The English survey’s parallel analysis suggested retaining two factors, capturing 28% cumulative variance  (Appendix Figure 9). These factors were interpreted as professional confidence and holistic life outlook. In contrast, the Mandarin and Hindi surveys exhibited higher cumulative variances of 57% and 78%, respectively (Appendix Figures 10 and 11). The Mandarin survey’s factor structure emphasized career confidence and social-emotional resilience, while the Hindi survey leaned toward a unified dimension with professional readiness and lifestyle alignment as key themes. Items like MEW_1 in the English survey and OLP_1 in the Hindi survey displayed low communalities, indicating areas for improvement.
Criterion validity, assessed through inter-item correlations, highlighted strong internal validity for the Hindi and Mandarin surveys, with correlations above 0.7 among most items as shown in the correlation matrices in Appendix Figures 5 and 7. However, in the English survey, items such as OLP_2 and MEW_1 showed weaker correlations, suggesting potential construct divergence or cultural differences in interpretation (Appendix Figure 3). Factor loadings for financial stability (FS_1 and FS_2) were particularly robust in the Mandarin and Hindi surveys, supporting the external, practical dimensions captured in these contexts (Appendix Figure 8).
When compared to existing psychometric tools, such as the Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy Scale (CDMSES) and the Student Burnout Inventory (SBI), this survey offers a more comprehensive perspective. The CDMSES primarily focuses on students’ confidence in making career decisions, while the SBI evaluates dimensions of academic burnout and engagement.6 7 Unlike these existing measures, our survey integrates professional, financial, personal, social, and emotional dimensions, providing a holistic understanding of students’ readiness for life after graduation.
The results demonstrate that this newly developed instrument captures a wider array of constructs relevant to life after graduation compared to existing tools. It fills a critical gap by offering a validated, multidimensional measure that is culturally inclusive and adaptable to different linguistic groups.
